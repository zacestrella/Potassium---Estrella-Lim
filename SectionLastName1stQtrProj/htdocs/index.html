    <p id="homepagedescription" class="textstyles">Our project proposal is about the transition of students from online schooling to in-person classes. We aim to determine how the two different environments affected the students' wellbeings. We plan to conduct a survey on our peers regarding how the change has made an impact on them. We will only be limiting it to our section, Grade 9 Potassium.
<br></br>
Our project is quite different in the way that our batch is the first in PSHS-MC to start our high school years entirely online. We continued this mode of learning until early this year, 2022. Since we have gotten used to just seeing our classmates and learning our lessons through screens, the change to wholly onsite learning can definitely have its impact. If other batches had FACE-TO-FACE to ONLINE, batch 2026 has ONLINE to FACE-TO-FACE.
