  <h1>  Effects of Online and In-person to students </h1>

    <h3> <b> In order to compare and contrast the 2 modes
      of learning, we must first define them </b>.</h3>

    <b>ONLINE LEARNING</b>
  <br></br>
  Online learning can be defined as any type of learning that happens over the internet. Instead of the typical classrooms with a teacher in front, you are given instructional material which you can complete at your own pace. This promotes self-study; from watching seminars by yourself online to a qualified virtual college degree program.

<b> FACE-TO-FACE LEARNING </b>
<br></br>
For face-to-face learning, you can expect the traditional kind of set-up involving in-person sessions with an instructor or a teacher. Unlike online learning, you cannot go at your own pace. The instructor sets the pace of learning which are then followed by the students. However, face-to-face learning is considered effective due to the live interaction of the instructor and students.

   <p>
  <b>COMPARING THE 2 MODES</b>
  <br></br>
For face-to-face learning, there are planned and structured classes according to a fixed schedule. Therfore, this makes its system of learning more disciplined. Since the students are in-person, classroom learning would also happen in a group setting and thus promote more interaction amongst the learners.

  <br></br>
  
On the other hand, online learning is more spontaneous. This kind of set-up allows learners to choose whether to take up a course or a learning module. The most beneficial aspect of this mode is that learners can do what they need to do at their own pace or whenever they choose. Since this mode also does not involve an instructor, learners are by themselves and have no interactions in this kind of setting. 

  <br></br>
  
Online learning is more spontaneous when compared to a planned, in-person session. Learners may choose to take up a course or a learning module online whenever inspiration or curiosity strikes. Best of all, they can do it at their own pace – whenever they choose. Since this kind of learning doesn’t involve a live instructor, the learner is by themselves in this setting.
