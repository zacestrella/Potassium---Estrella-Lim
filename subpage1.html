  <p> 
    <b><u>ONLINE LEARNING</u></b>
  <br></br>
  Online learning can be defined as any type of learning that happens over the internet. Instead of the typical classrooms with a teacher in front, you are given instructional material which you can complete at your own pace. This promotes self-study; from watching seminars by yourself online to a qualified virtual college degree program.
  <br></br>
   An advantage of online learning is how efficient it is. It's easy for the teachers to send their lessons to their students and its convenient for the learners to access them as well. Plus, an online platform eliminates costs of travelling and meals which are great for the students in need of financial aid to go to school.
    <br></br>
    However, online learning comes with its disadvantages as well. For one, it will be quite hard for the student to focus on their screens for long periods of time, which is an issue that many learners experienced over the pandemic. It also gives the students a sense of isolation because they're not with their peers, which could cause them fatigue and feel lack of support.

<p>
<b> <u>FACE-TO-FACE LEARNING</u> </b>
<br></br>
For face-to-face learning, you can expect the traditional kind of set-up involving in-person sessions with an instructor or a teacher. Unlike online learning, you cannot go at your own pace. The instructor sets the pace of learning which are then followed by the students. 
    <br></br>
    However, face-to-face learning is considered effective due to the live interaction of the instructor and students. This also promotes bonding with your peers which is beneficial in the students' mental wellbeing. There are also notably less distractions for the learner in a classroom setting compared to when he/she is in an online setting.
  <br></br>
    However, this mode also comes with its disadvantages. Like what was mentioned, you will need to get out your money for the costs of physical learning, such as the transportation and the meals you will either need to buy or take with you. The student will also have to be at a certain place at a certain time, unlike in online learning where you can take your class/es anywhere with you as long as you have gadgets.

   <p>
  <b><u>COMPARING THE 2 MODES</u></b>
  <br></br>
For face-to-face learning, there are planned and structured classes according to a fixed schedule. Therfore, this makes its system of learning more disciplined. Since the students are in-person, classroom learning would also happen in a group setting and thus promote more interaction amongst the learners.

  <br></br>
  
On the other hand, online learning is more spontaneous. This kind of set-up allows learners to choose whether to take up a course or a learning module. The most beneficial aspect of this mode is that learners can do what they need to do at their own pace or whenever they choose. Since this mode also does not involve an instructor, learners are by themselves and have no interactions in this kind of setting. 

  <br></br>

   However as we can see, both come with their disadvantages as well such as costs, inefficient focus, and lack of interactions. In this website we will aim to find out which type of learning is more advantageous and effective for students like us.
